A DIY air quality monitoring device 

# ESP32 Air Quality Monitoring Device

## About
This project is a portable air quality monitoring device built using ESP32. I made this project to learn sensor interfacing, ADC usage, and real-world hardware debugging.

## Components Used
- ESP32
- MQ-135, MQ-2, MQ-7
- BMP280
- OLED & LCD display with I2C module
- Battery and charging module
- Boost & Buck converter
- Breadboard & veloboard

## Software
- MicroPython
- Code written using reference examples and AI-assisted help
- Modified and tested with real sensor data

## Features
- Measures air quality using gas sensors
- Displays temperature and altitude
- Real-time values shown on display
- Portable and battery powered and cost effective

## What I Learned
- Sensor behavior and ADC limitations
- Power supply issues with multiple sensors
- Soldering & prototyping
- Hardware–software integration using MicroPython
